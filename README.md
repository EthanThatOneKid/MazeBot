## Bot Commands
* `!START_MAZE`: Begins a new instance of the game. Clears any current game.
* `!END_MAZE`: Ends the current game.
* `!info`: Prints any contextual help.
* `!inventory`: Prints a list of items currently in the inventory.
* `!score`: Prints the current score.
* Now here's where it gets interesting:
  * Make sure your command begins with `!`.
  * Then, use a verb and another word.
  * For example, a valid command would be `!grab sword` or `!pick bottle`.
  * These types of commands can result in many different outcomes.
